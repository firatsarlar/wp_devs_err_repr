# Webpack Dev Server Accessibility Issue Reproduction

This repository is designed to demonstrate an issue with accessing the Webpack Dev Server from other devices on the same local network, despite the server being accessible via local IPs on the host machine.

## Description

The Webpack Dev Server starts normally on the host machine and is accessible via both `localhost` and the machine's local IP address. However, attempts to access the server from other devices on the same network (like phones, tablets, or virtual machines) fail, despite a simple Python HTTP server working under similar conditions.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have `node.js` and `npm` installed on your machine.
- You are using a Windows, Linux, or Mac OS machine.

## Installing

To install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firatsarlar/wp_devs_err_repr.git
cd wp_devs_err_repr
npm install
```

## Reproducing the Issue

To reproduce the issue, you need to:

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Start the Webpack Dev Server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. In a separate terminal, serve the `dist` directory using Python's built-in HTTP server (ensure you've built the project before running):
   ```bash
   npm run python_serve
   ```

## Testing

- The Webpack Dev Server can be accessed on the host machine at `http://localhost:8080` and `http://192.168.1.50:8080`.
- The Python HTTP server should be accessible on the same and other devices on the network at `http://192.168.1.50:8000`.

Try accessing both servers from other devices on your network to observe the issue.
